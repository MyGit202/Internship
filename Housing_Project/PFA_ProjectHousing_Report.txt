Motivation for the Problem Undertaken

Houses are one of the necessary need of each and every person around the globe and therefore housing and real estate market is one of the markets which is one of the major contributors in the world’s economy. It is a very large market and there are various companies working in the domain. Data science comes as a very 	important tool to solve problems in the domain to help the companies increase their overall revenue, profits, improving their marketing strategies and focusing on changing trends in house sales and purchases. Predictive modelling, Market mix modelling,recommendation systems are some of the machine learning techniques used for achieving the business goals for housing companies. Our problem is related to one such housing company.


Analytical Problem Framing
Mathematical/ Analytical Modeling of the Problem.


From this statastical analysis we make some of the interpretations that,
1. Maximum standard deviation of 8957.44 is observed in LotArea column.
2. Maximum SalePrice of a house observed is 755000 and minimum is 34900.
3. In the columns Id, MSSubclass, LotArea, MasVnrArea, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfsF, TotalBsmtSF, 1stFlrSF, 2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtFullBath, HalfBath, TotRmsAbvGrd, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, 3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, Miscval, salePrice mean is considerably greater than median so the columns are positively skewed.
4. In the columns FullBath, BedroomAbvGr, Fireplaces, Garagecars, GarageArea, YrSold Median is greater than mean so the columns are negatively skewed.
5. In the columns Id, MSSubClass, LotFrontage, LotArea, MasVnrArea, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, 1stFlrSF, 2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, GrLivArea, BsmtHalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, ToRmsAbvGrd, GarageArea, WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, 3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea, MiscVal, SalePrice there is considerable difference between the 75 percentile and maximum so outliers are present.

Data Preprocessing Done

We first done data cleaning. We first looked percentage of values missing in columns then we imputed missing values .

We then explored categorical variables.

We observed that there is only one unique value present in Utilities so will be dropping this column. Then we encoded all the categorical columns into numerical colums using dummy variables.

Then we checked the correlation with the help of heatmap
While checking the heatmap of correlation we observed that,

1. SalePrice is highly positively correlated with the columns OverallQual, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, TotalBsmtSF, 1stFlrSF, GrLivArea, FullBath, TotRmsAbvGrd,    GarageCars, GarageArea.

2. SalePrice is negatively correlated with OverallCond, KitchenAbvGr, Encloseporch, YrSold.
3. We observe multicollinearity in between columns so we will be using Principal Component Analysis(PCA).
4. No correlation has been observed between the column Id and other columns so we will be dropping this column.
   Data Inputs- Logic- Output Relationships
   
   Here we check the correlation between all our feature variables with target variable label.
 
 Correlation with target variable label.

1. The column OverallQual is most positively correlated with SalePrice.
2. The column KitchenAbvGrd is most negatively correlated with SalePrice.

Set of assumptions related to the problem under consideration

By looking into the target vaariable label we assumed that it was a Regression type of problem.
We observed multicollinearity in between columns so we assumed that we will be using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
We also observed that only one single unique value was present in Utilities column so we assumed that we will be dropping this columns.
Hardware and Software Requirements and Tools Used
This project was done on laptop with i5 processor with quad cores and eight threads with 8gb of ram and latest GeForce GTX 1650 GPU on Anaconda, jupyter notebook.

The tools, libraries and packages we used for accomplishing this project are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy stats, sklearn.decomposition pca, sklearn standardscaler,  GridSearchCV, joblib.

Through pandas library we loaded our csv file ‘Data file’ into dataframe and performed data manipulation and analysis. 
With the help of numpy we worked with arrays.
With the help of matplotlib and seaborn we did plot various graphs and figures and done data visualization.
With scipy stats we treated outliers through winsorization technique.
With sklearn.decomposition’s pca package we reduced the number of feature variables from 256 to 100 by plotting scrre plot with their Eigenvalues and chose the number of columns on the basis of their nodes.
With sklearn’s standardscaler package we scaled all the feature variables onto single scale.
Through GridSearchCV we were able to find the right parameters for hyperparameter tuning.
Through joblib we saved our model in csv format.




Model/s Development and Evaluation 

Identification of possible problem-solving approaches (methods)
We first converted all our categorical variables to numeric variables with the help of dummy variables to checkout and dropped the columns which we felt were unnecessary.

We observed skewness in data so we tried to remove the skewness through treating outliers with winsorization technique.
The data was improper scaled so we scaled the feature variables on a single scale using sklearn’s StandardScaler package.
There were too many (256) feature variables in the data so we reduced it to 100 with the help of Principal Component Analysis(PCA) by plotting Eigenvalues and taking the number of nodes as our number of feature variables.
 
Testing of Identified Approaches (Algorithms)
The algorithms we used for the training and testing are as follows:-
Linear Regression
Lasso
Ridge
Elastic Net
SVR
KNeighbors Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Ada Boost Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
 
Run and Evaluate selected models
The algorithms we used are above.

The results observed over different evaluation metrics.

Key Metrics for success in solving problem under consideration
we used the metric Root Mean Squared Error by selecting the Ridge Regressor model which was giving us best(minimum) RMSE score.

Interpretation of the Results
From the visualization we interpreted that the target variable SalePrice was highly positively correlated with the columns GrLivArea, YearBuilt, OverallQual, GarageCars, GarageArea.
From the preprocessing we interpreted that data was improper scaled.
From the modeling we interpreted that after hyperparameter tuning Ridge Regressor works best with respect to our model with minimum RMSE of 31806. 


CONCLUSION 

Key Findings and Conclusions of the Study
In this project we have tried to show how the house prices vary and what are the factors related to the changing of house prices.The best(minimum) RMSE score was achieved using the best parameters of Ridge Regressor through GridSearchCV though Lasso Regressor model performed well too.

Learning Outcomes of the Study in respect of Data Science

This project has demonstrated the importance of sampling effectively, modelling and predicting data.
Through different powerful tools of visualization we were able to analyse and interpret different hidden insights about the data.
Through data cleaning we were able to remove unnecessary columns and outliers from our dataset due to which our model would have suffered from overfitting or underfitting.
The few challenges while working on this project where:-
Improper scaling
Too many features
Missing values

Skewed data due to outliers

The data was improper scaled so we scaled it to a single scale using sklearns’s package StandardScaler.
There were too many(256) features present in the data so we applied Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and found out the Eigenvalues and on the basis of number of nodes we were able able to reduce our features upto 90 columns.
There were lot of missing values present in different columns which we imputed on the basis of our understanding.
The columns were skewed due to presence of outliers which we handled through winsorization technique.

Limitations of this work and Scope for Future Work

While we couldn’t reach out goal of minimum RMSE in house price prediction without letting the model to overfit, we did end up creating a system that can with enough 	time and data get very close to that goal. As with any project there is room for improvement here. The very nature of this project allows for multiple algorithms to be integrated together as modules and their results can be combined to increase the accuracy of the final result. This model can further be improved with the addition of more algorithms into it. However, the output of these algorithms needs to be in the same format as the others. Once that condition is satisfied, the modules are easy to add as done in the code. This provides a great degree of modularity and vesatility to the project.
